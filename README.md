 # **Math Formula Extractor**

This app extracts mathematical formulae from images using the Gemini-Pro-Vision AI model and converts them into LaTeX code. The LaTeX code can then be downloaded by clicking the <b>Download LaTeX File</b> button.  

 ## **Features**

-Upload images containing mathematical formulas (JPEG, PNG, or JPG formats).

-Extract formulas using AI and display them in both text and LaTeX format.

-Download the extracted formulas as a LaTeX file for further use.
